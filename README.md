The functionalities for the convex hull computation are all contained in ./content/src/FastQHull.h

./content/Sample_01/Main_01.cpp reports an example considering a sampled point cloud

./content/Sample_02/Main_02.cpp reports several examples considering some clouds imported from exemplificative .stl files

When compiling FastQHull with OpenMP enabled, the multithreaded version is automatically activated.

If you are interested in knowing the theory behind the code refer to./content/Fast_QHull.pdf
